            <p>
              Naruto Uzumaki is a young boy from the Hidden Leaf Village and the
              biggest problem child at the ninja academy. He causes mischief
              every day and is constantly being scolded by his teacher, Iruka
              Umino. He has fallen so far behind in his studies that his
              graduation is uncertain, but Naruto actually dreams of becoming
              the leader of the village, known as the Hokage, and vows to one
              day become the No. 1 ninja.However, all the adults in the village
              treat Naruto with disdain due to a secret surrounding his birth.
              12 years ago, when Naruto was just a baby, the Nine-Tailed Fox
              attacked the village, and the only way to stop it was to seal it
              inside of him. This fact is first revealed to him by Mizuki, an
              instructor at the academy who uses Naruto to steal the Scroll of
              Sealing from the current Hokage. Once the deed is done, he appears
              before the young ninja and discloses the shocking truth behind his
              birth. Naruto manages to defeat Mizuki with Iruka’s help, who
              despite knowing about Naruto’s past, has always believed in him.
              After learning Iruka’s true feelings, Naruto gains a renewed
              determination to pursue his dream.After successfully graduating
              from the academy alongside fellow students Sasuke Uchiha and
              Sakura Haruno, Naruto finally takes the first steps on his journey
              as a real ninja!

            <p>
              Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of
              Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi,
              slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to
              avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming
              a ninja, and, through competition with his rival and best friend,
              Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills but eventually
              grows dissatisfied with his progress. He defects from Konoha so
              that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge and
              master the Cursed Seal of Heaven. His years of seeking vengeance
              and the actions that followed became increasingly demanding,
              irrational, and isolated from others, leading him to be branded as
              an international criminal. After learning the truth of his
              brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the
              Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto,
              Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help
              protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as
              the "Supporting Kage"

            <p>
              Sakura is the only child of Kizashi and Mebuki Haruno. She had a
              healthy childhood, raised by her parents without any serious
              tragedy or complications, unlike her team members. When she
              entered Konoha's Academy, a few of the girls in her class started
              picking on her because of her broad forehead. Sakura tried to
              combat their teasing by hiding her forehead with her bangs, but
              this caused the girls to bully her even more. Ino Yamanaka, one of
              her classmates, saw this, and defended Sakura from her bullies and
              encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather than hide it.Over
              the following years, Ino's guidance and friendship helped Sakura
              become comfortable with herself and develop into her own person.
              Though she felt indebted to Ino for helping her, Sakura began to
              feel that she was living in Ino's shadow when she, instead, wanted
              to be Ino's equal.

            <h1 class="text-container-heading">Itachi Uchiha</h1>
            <p>
              Itachi first appeared in Volume 16 of the Naruto manga and anime
              in March 2003 and April 2004, respectively. The original manga ran
              from 1999–2014, with a follow-up volume in 2015. Versions of the
              anime series ran on TV from 2002–17.Itachi had black hair, tied
              into a ponytail with long parted bangs. He wore a headband with a
              leaf symbol with a horizontal slash over it, signifying his
              “missing-nin” status, meaning that he had cut ties with his native
              village, the Hidden Leaf Village. Itachi was also often outfitted
              in a long black robe with white and red cloud patterns on it,
              signaling his allegiance to the Akatsuki, a terrorist
              organization. He rarely showed emotion but was prone to shows of
              force. Having been traumatized by witnessing a previous war, he
              was a pacifist and would often run from confrontation. He
              possessed the powerful Sharingan and was a ninja prodigy in his
              youth.Itachi is the brother of one of the main characters of
              Naruto, Sasuke. For much of the series’s duration, Itachi was
              reviled by fans for killing his and Sasuke’s entire clan, the
              Uchiha clan. It’s eventually revealed that Itachi didn’t murder
              his clan in cold blood. In fact, he was ordered to murder them by
              the leadership of his village to stop a coup d’etat, meaning that
              he acted in his village’s and Sasuke’s best interests the whole
              time. This was done to prevent another world war between the
              villages, which Itachi was afraid of. After killing his clan, he
              was allowed to spare his brother Sasuke, hoping that the hatred
              and trauma from the event would mold him into a strong ninja.
              Afterwards, he became part of the Akatsuki as a spy, making Itachi
              more prominent as an antagonist.

            <p>
              Kakashi Hatake is a character from the anime Naruto who is known
              as "Kakashi of the Sharingan" and "Copy Ninja". He is a shinobi
              from Konoha's Hatake clan and is considered one of Konoha's most
              talented ninja. Kakashi is skilled in ninjutsu, including the
              Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, and is also proficient with a
              variety of weapons, such as bows and arrows, kusarigama, chains,
              and wire strings.Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, one of the
              most powerful shinobi Konoha has ever produced, known as "White
              Fang of the Leaf". Kakashi is a child prodigy who is hailed as the
              best of his generation during his time at the ninja academy. He
              becomes a Genin at age 5, a Chuunin at age 6, and later a Jounin
              and a member of the AnBu Assassination squad for Hidden Leaf
              Village.Kakashi is serious and observant, and approaches fights
              with unwavering attentiveness. This seriousness can also lead him
              to come off as painfully blunt when his students require a stern
              lesson. He values teamwork and the lives of his students over all
              else, even if it jeopardizes their mission.Kakashi is often looked
              to for advice and leadership. He teaches the importance of
              teamwork to his students on team 7, a lesson he received from his
              childhood friend Obito Uchiha. After the fourth shinobi world war,
              Kakashi becomes Konoha's sixth hokage.

              member of the Uzumaki clan, a powerful ninja clan, and has the
              ability to generate large amounts of chakra. His power comes from

              six forms of nature.Pain, also known as Nagato, is a character in
              the anime series Naruto who is the leader of Akatsuki and
              Amegakure.Pain's goal is to capture the tailed beasts that are
              sealed in people, and he seals most of the beasts in a Gedo
              statue. His advisor then tells him to capture the Nine-Tailed
              Demon Fox, which is sealed inside Naruto Uzumaki, the series'
              protagonist.Pain has a tragic past. He was born on the outskirts
              of Amegakure to Ise and Fusō, and during the Second Shinobi World
              War, two shinobi from Konoha broke into Nagato's house and killed
              his parents. Pain became disillusioned with the world after
              experiencing the loss of his family and friends to war, and began
              to believe that only pain and suffering could bring about peace.
              He believes that no one can understand the value of peace without
              first experiencing the horror of war, and makes a point in
              teaching suffering to anyone he speaks to.Pain is partnered with
              Konan, and the three were trained by Jiraiya in Ninjutsu. Pain's
              main body is the Deva Path, which has gravitational-like control,
              which allows it to push things away and attract them.
